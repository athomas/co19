/// @assertion If an unqualified identifier lexically resolves to an extension
/// method of the surrounding extension, then that identifier is not equivalent
/// to this.id, rather the invocation is equivalent to an explicit invocation of
/// that extension method on this (which we already know has a compatible type
/// for the extension): Ext<T1,â€¦,Tn>(this).id, where Ext is the surrounding
/// extension and T1 through Tn are its type parameters, if any. The invocation
/// works whether or not the names of the extension or parameters are actually
/// accessible, it is not a syntactic rewrite.
