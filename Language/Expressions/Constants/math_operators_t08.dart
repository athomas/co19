/// @assertion A constant expression is an expression whose value can never
/// change, and that can be evaluated entirely at compile time.
/// A constant expression is one of the following:
/// . . .
/// • An expression of the form e1 + e2 where e1 and e2 are constant expressions
///   that evaluate to a numeric or string value or to null.
/// • An expression of one of the forms −e, e1 - e2, e1 * e2, e1 / e2, e1 ˜/ e2,
///   e1 > e2, e1 < e2, e1 >= e2, e1 <= e2 or e1 % e2, where e, e1 and e2 are
///   constant expressions that evaluate to a numeric value or to null.
/// @description Checks that various expressions of the form e1 + e2 can be
/// elements of a constant list literal and are, therefore, constant
/// expressions.
/// @note The test initially was a part of math_operator_t01.dart. Should pass
/// on all the configurations including web.
