/// @assertion A constant expression is an expression whose value can never
/// change, and that can be evaluated entirely at compile time.
/// A constant expression is one of the following:
/// â€¢ A literal number.
/// @description Checks that various literal numbers can be elements of a
/// constant list literal and are, therefore, constant expressions. Minus sign
/// is not a part of a number literal so those are not included in this test.
/// @note Should be OK both with dart and dart2js runs.
