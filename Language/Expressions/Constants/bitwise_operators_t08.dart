/// @assertion A constant expression is an expression whose value can never
/// change, and that can be evaluated entirely at compile time.
/// A constant expression is one of the following:
/// . . .
/// An expression of one of the forms [e1 Ëœ/ e2], [e1 >> e2], [e1 >>> e2], or
/// [e1 << e2] is potentially constant if [e1] and [e2] are both potentially
/// constant expressions.
/// It is further constant if both [e1] and [e2] are constant expressions that
/// both evaluate to an instance of [int]
/// @description Checks that it is a compile-time error when an expression of
/// the form e1 >>> e2 where e1 or e2 does not evaluate to an integer value, is
/// used to initialize a constant variable.
