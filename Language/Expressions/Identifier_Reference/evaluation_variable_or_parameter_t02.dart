/// @assertion Evaluation of an identifier expression e of the form id proceeds

/// Let d be the innermost declaration in the enclosing lexical scope whose name
/// is id or id=. If no such declaration exists in the lexical scope, let d be

/// â€¢ If d is a local variable or formal parameter then e evaluates to the
///   current binding of id.
/// @description Checks that a reference to a local variable is evaluated
