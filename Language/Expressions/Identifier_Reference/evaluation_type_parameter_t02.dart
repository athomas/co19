/// @assertion Evaluation of an identifier expression e of the form id proceeds
/// as follows:
/// Let d be the innermost declaration in the enclosing lexical scope whose name
/// is id or id=. If no such declaration exists in the lexical scope, let d be
/// the declaration of the inherited member named id if it exists.
/// ...
/// â€¢ If d is a type parameter T, then the value of e is the value of the actual
///   type argument corresponding to T that was passed to the generative
///   constructor that created the current binding of this. If, however, e occurs
///   inside a static member, a compile-time error occurs.
/// @description Checks that there is a compile-time error if identifier
/// expression in a return statement refers to a type parameter inside a static
/// method.
