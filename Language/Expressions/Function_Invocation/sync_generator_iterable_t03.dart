/// @assertion The iterable implementation must comply with the contract of
/// Iterable and should not take any steps identiÔ¨Åed as exceptionally efficient
/// in that contract.
///    The contract explicitly mentions a number of situations where certain
///  iterables could be more efficient than normal. For example, by precomputing
///  their length. Normal iterables must iterate over their elements to
///  determine their length. This is certainly true in the case of a synchronous
///  generator, where each element is computed by a function. It would not be
///  acceptable to pre-compute the results of the generator and cache them,
///  for example.
///
/// @description Check that method Iterable.contains() called on Iterable
/// instance, returned by synchronous generator, iterates through all elements.
