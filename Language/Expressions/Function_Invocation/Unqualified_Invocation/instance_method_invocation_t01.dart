/// @assertion An unqualified function invocation i has the form
/// id(a1, ..., an, xn+1: an+1, ..., xn+k: an+k), where id is an identifier.
/// If there exists a lexically visible declaration named id, let fid be the
/// innermost such declaration. Then:
/// . . .
///  â€¢ Otherwise, fid is necessarily an instance method or getter of the
///    enclosing class C, and i is equivalent to the ordinary method invocation
///    this.id(a1, ..., an, xn+1: an+1, ..., xn+k: an+k).
/// . . .
/// @description Checks that if fid is an instance method of a class,
