/// @assertion When iteration over the iterable is started, by getting an
/// iterator j from the iterable and calling moveNext(), execution of the body
/// of f will begin. When f terminates, j is positioned after its last element,
/// so that its current value is null and the current call to moveNext() on j
/// returns false, as will all further calls.
///    Each iterator starts a separate computation. If the sync* function is
/// impure, the sequence of values yielded by each iterator may differ.
///    One can derive more than one iterator from a given iterable. Note that
/// operations on the iterable itself can create distinct iterators. An example
/// would be length. It is conceivable that different iterators might yield
/// sequences of different length. The same care needs to be taken when writing
/// sync* functions as when writing an Iterator class. In particular, it should
/// handle multiple simultaneous iterators gracefully. If the iterator depends
/// on external state that might change, it should check that the state is still
/// valid after every yield (and maybe throw a ConcurrentModificationError if
/// it isnâ€™t).
///    Each iterator runs with its own shallow copies of all local variables; in
/// particular, each iterator has the same initial arguments, even if their
/// bindings are modified by the function. Two executions of an iterator
/// interact only via state outside the function.
///
/// @description Check that each iterator has the shallow copies of initial
/// arguments
