/// @assertion A generic type alias is a declaration [D] of one of the following
/// forms:
/// ...
/// m typedef S? id<X1 extends B1, . . . , Xs extends Bs>(
///   T1 p1, . . . , Tn pn, [Tn+1 pn+1, . . . , Tn+k pn+k]);
/// ...
/// where [m] is derived from metadata, [T] is a type, and [S?] is a type or the
/// empty string. Let [S0] be [S?] if it is a type, otherwise let [S0] be
/// [dynamic]. The associated type of [D], call it [F], is, respectively:
/// ...
///   S0 Function(T1, . . . , Tn, [Tn+1, . . . , Tn+k])
/// ...
