/// @assertion The active stack trace is an object whose toString() method
/// produces a string that is a record of exactly those function activations
/// within the current isolate that had not completed execution at the point
/// where the current exception was thrown.
///   This implies that no synthetic function activations may be added to the
/// trace, nor may any source level activations be omitted. This means, for
/// example, that any inlining of functions done as an optimization must not be
/// visible in the trace. Similarly, any synthetic routines used by the
/// implementation must not appear in the trace.
///   Nothing is said about how any native function calls may be represented in
/// the trace.
///   Note that we say nothing about the identity of the stack trace, or what
/// notion of equality is deÔ¨Åned for stack traces.
///   The term position should not be interpreted as a line number, but rather as
/// a precise position - the exact character index of the expression that raised
/// the exception.
/// @description Checks that stack trace contains the names of relevant
/// functions.
/// @author kaigorodov
/// @note Can't really test anything on stack trace even if its toString()
/// contains certain function names due to possible minification.
