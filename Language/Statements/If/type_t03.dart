/// @assertion An if statement of the form if (b) s1 else s2.
/// If:
/// • b shows that a variable v has type T .
/// • v is not potentially mutated in s1 or within a closure.
/// • If the variable v is accessed by a closure in s1 then the variable v is
///   not potentially mutated anywhere in the scope of v.
/// Then the type of v is known to be T in s1.
/// @description Checks that if b shows that v has type T and v is not
/// potentially mutated anywhere in the scope of v, then the type of v is
/// known to be T in s1, regardless of whether there are closures capturing v.
/// Case with closures.
